Hello üëãüèº! I'm David , a travelling product designer from the UK. I specialise in creating digital products (apps and/or web) that help people be their best selves. Whether that's helping to improve someone's wellbeing, save some extra money, learn a new skill or just have fun. I truly believe in the power of technology to have a positive impact in people's lives.

My background is in games and User Experience (UX), designing products that are simple for people to use, but most importantly, help them to achieve their goals. But what I really care about is shipping cool things, testing new ideas and making a difference to people's lives - and I get stuck into whatever I can to make projects I'm passionate about a success.

### History

#### The early days
I've always been obsessed with games and technology, but it was getting access to the internet that made me realise that I could not just play games, but I could make them too. Online I met other enterprising teens who wanted to make things, forming a community where we'd share our ideas, creations and ultimately all our failures!

As we grew up our projects got more ambitious and one of those projects grew into Lasuni. With my internet friends Jason Bryan and Amber Discko: we designed, shipped, marketed and grew an online community. We managed to grow a highly engaged audience, and it helped me to fund my Computer Science degree without any student loans.

Lasuni taught me a lot, but it also taught me how much I didn't know. I had the creative bug, and wanted to learn as much as I could from actual professionals - that's when I found Mind Candy.

#### Mind Candy
While on holiday in the US, I created a hand-crafted application to Mind Candy and emailed it to recruitment and the CEO. Thankfully it was well received with the CEO tweeting about my efforts -  landing me an interview at Mind Candy but also at 2 other start-ups. I was given me the opportunity to work on a variety of projects from the core game and safety tools to the mobile-first future of Moshi. In my last year I led UX and later product management for a new mobile, creative, community - PopJam, where I met Marcus and Dan.

#### Play
Working on mobile games, we realised how powerful game mechanics can be in driving behaviours. Play formed on the belief that we could use our games experience to build compelling products to help people and businesses achieve their goals. The dream team was back together with Marcus (CEO), Dan (CTO) and myself (CPO) heading up our respective skillsets.

With our first client we designed, built, shipped and ran Bupa Boost as a live service. With a lot of hard work we kept growing the business and we used our learnings of how these huge businesses work to create Totem, our attempt to productise good company culture. Over my 4 years there I grew my product team to 8 super talented individuals, and we designed and shipped tens of products for some of the biggest companies in the UK.

#### Now
On the 27th June 2018, I took the heart-wrenching decision to leave Play behind, and I left the UK to travel with my boyfriend Remi. We're currently somewhere in SE Asia and will be arriving in Australia towards the end of the year. You can follow along with my travels on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dasaii) or [Instagram](https://instagram.com/dasaii) if you'd like.

#### And outside of work?
Well, Im currently full-time travelling/homeless - so there's not much difference! But while not making stuff, I love to travel (clearly), take bad photos on my phone, run, watch far too much Netflix. I'm still a tragic 90s kid (waiting on my letter to Hogwarts) and get my games fix on the go with my Nintendo Switch.

#### TL;DR
I like making stuff. I'm also generally a bit of a nerd.

### Business friends
I've been lucky enough to work with these forward-thinking companies

### Testimonials
I didn't pay for these

### How we can work together
I currently am open to working on small remote projects thats interest me.
