Hello üëãüèº! I'm David , a product designer from the UK, currently living in Sydney, Australia. I specialise in creating digital products that help people be their best selves. Whether that's helping to [improve someone's wellbeing](/work/bupa-boost), save some extra money, [learn a new skill](/work/digital-fitness) or [just have fun](/work/moshi-monsters). I truly believe in the power of technology to have a positive impact in people's lives.

My background is in games and User Experience (UX), designing products that are simple for people to use, but most importantly, help them to achieve their goals. But what I really care about is shipping cool things, testing new ideas and making a difference to people's lives. You can see a few of the products I've worked on in my [Portfolio](/portfolio).

### History

#### The early days
I've always been obsessed with games and technology, but it was getting access to the internet that made me realise that I could not just play games, but I could make them too. Online I met other enterprising teens who wanted to make games, forming a community where we'd share our ideas, creations and ultimately all our failures!

As we grew up our projects got more ambitious and one of those projects grew into [Lasuni](/work/lasuni). With my internet friends [Jason Bryan](https://www.instagram.com/travelistlife) and [Amber Discko](https://twitter.com/amberdiscko): we designed, shipped, marketed and built an online community. We managed to grow a highly engaged audience, and it helped me to fund my Computer Science degree without any student loans.

Lasuni taught me a lot, but it also taught me how much I didn't know. I had the creative bug, and wanted to learn as much as I could from actual professionals - that's when I found Mind Candy.

#### Mind Candy
While on holiday in the US, I created a [hand-crafted application to Mind Candy](/work/moshi-monsters) and emailed it to recruitment and [Michael Acton Smith](https://twitter.com/acton), the CEO. Thankfully it was well received with Michael tweeting about my efforts ‚Äî landing me an interview at Mind Candy but also at 2 other start-ups. Everything worked out and I landed the gig at Mind Candy - during my time I was given the opportunity to work on a variety of projects from the core game and safety tools to the mobile-first future of Moshi.

![Mind Candy  - 2013](/images/mindcandy.jpg "Mind Candy - 2013")

At Mind Candy I learned tons: how startups work; what product management is; research (I ran play-testing every week); running an effective team; presenting to stakeholders; and the importance of team culture in building great things. In my last year I led UX and later product management for a new mobile, creative, community - PopJam, where I met Marcus and Dan.

#### Play
Working on mobile games, we realised how powerful game mechanics can be in driving behaviours. Play formed on the belief that we could use our games experience to build compelling products to help people and businesses achieve their goals. The dream team was back together with Marcus Thornley (CEO), [Dan Atherton](https://twitter.com/RabidBadger80) (CTO) and myself (CPO) heading up our respective skillsets.

![Team Play - May 2016](/images/teamplay_2016.jpg "Team Play - May 2016")

With our first client we designed, built, shipped and ran [Bupa Boost](/work/bupa-boost) as a live service. With a lot of hard work we kept growing the business and we used our learnings of how these huge businesses work to create Totem, our attempt to productise good company culture. Over my 4 years there I grew my product team to 7 super talented individuals, and we designed and shipped tens of products for some of the biggest companies in the UK.

#### Travel
On the 27th June 2018, I took the heart-wrenching decision to leave Play, and I left the UK to travel with my boyfriend, [Remi](https://instagram.com/remionthego). We had an incredible 6 months travelling around SE Asia and Japan.

![Chiang Mai - July 2018](/images/travelling.jpg "Chiang Mai - July 2018")

#### Now
Currently, I'm working at [Deputy](https://deputy.com), helping to simpify shift work for 100,000s of businesses around the world.

#### And outside of work?
When I'm not making stuff, I love to travel, take [bad photos on my phone](https://instagram.com/dasaii), run, and watch far too much Netflix. Other important things to note: I'm a Ravenclaw, aspiring Pokemon Master and my favourite film is the Lion King. I get my games fix on-the-go with my Nintendo Switch, I'm currently playing Super Mario 3D All Stars.

#### TL;DR
I like making stuff. I'm also generally a bit of a nerd.

      "I worked with David at first Mind Candy and then at Play - where he led product across both consultancy projects and internal IP, managing a growing team that figured out how gamified digital products could change the world of work.
      If you know him, or read the other recommendations (especially the ones from his Play team), you'll see that he's exceptional at what he does. Listening, making connections/ seeing patterns, focusing on users, conceptualising and defining products that are like no other - he can do it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      What's even more unique though is his humility and positivity. He's enthusiastic about life and people and learning - and how digital products can unlock human potential and happiness."

      "I've worked closely with David for 6 years. In that time we have created products for many big name companies and brands. He has an amazing understanding of what makes a product engaging. Without a doubt the success of every product we have worked on, has been a direct result of his insight and input into the process.
    </p><p>
      Over the years he provided mentoring and training to his team and has left behind a product team that follow his no nonsense methodology and appetite for excellence."

  "David was my go-to person at Play as he brilliantly combined business knowledge, UX expertise and project management skills that I struggle to find in most agencies. I was very impressed on how quickly David grasped the business problem we were trying to tackle and bring a range of creative solutions to the problems. As a client of his, I always had the confidence that under David's direction, the team would deliver high quality UX solutions and designs and on time, something invaluable for me in the consulting industry. Highly recommend!

    "I had the pleasure of teaming up directly with him on many products and I was surprised how much I learned from him every time. Annoyingly, not that you'd expect with someone quite so professional and talented, he is also a bloody lovely guy too. Teams that work with him, respect him, his knowledge and like him in equal amounts. He impeccably gains insight about a problem and swiftly delivers a brilliant solution that not only nails all business goals, but never loses sight of the end user and their engagement.
