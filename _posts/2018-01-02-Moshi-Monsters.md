### TL;DR
I designed games and updates for millions of kids playing Moshi Monsters. I worked on all aspects of the online game including community tools and the main website. Then my focus was on imagining the future of Moshi Monsters on mobile.

### Background
Moshi Monsters is a BAFTA award winning game for kids aged 6-12, with over 80 million players in 150 countries it is was one of the fastest growing children's properties ever.

I joined [Mind Candy](http://mindcandy.com) in April 2012 after creating a hand-crafted application to get their attention. My first projects were on the Moshi Monsters team. When I joined I was currently the only UX designer meaning I got to work on a wide variety of projects. Later I would be joined by 2 additional UX designers and a user researcher. During my time at Mind Candy I ran play-testing sessions every week testing the latest ideas we were working on.

### What I did
In my time at Mind Candy I was involved in a wide variety of projects, I started working on community tools, helping to make the task of moderating 80m kids more efficient. Later I worked on revamping the website and the core UI of the game including registration. The bulk of my time was designing and prototyping mobile versions of Moshi Monsters which were unfortunately never released. After working on Moshi Monsters I moved onto [PopJam](/work/popjam/), a creative community for kids.

An interesting challenge when working on the UX for the main game was balancing the ease-of-use with the fun - part of the success of Moshi Monsters was exploring the game and discovering exciting new areas that weren't necessarily obvious. Another important area is ensuring that we're designing what the kids actually want, and dealing with the specifics of designing kids products.

### Creating your first monster
Acquisition is hugely important for any product, and for Moshi Monsters it required users to go through the registration process. We had explored removing a lot of the registration to allow users to play first and then sign up to save their process, however it turned out to be to technically time-consuming with the legacy backend.

Instead, we decided to try to optimise the registration while solving a few key issues. The existing registration flow was working quite well, though we saw drop-offs in a few areas. Due to COPPA regulation parents are required to approve their child before they could play, in the old flow however it wasn't clear what the child was meant to be completing and what the parent was. Another issue was if a child entered the incorrect parent email (pretty common) they would have to start the process again, losing their unique owners name and all their hard work! There was also confusing terminology: the usernames were called 'Owner names' but children weren't allowed to enter their real name and it had to be unique, plus there was a separate monster name.

##### Key issues:
- Remove unnecessary questions (we asked for age and date of birth separately)
- Clearly separate the part of the registration for the child and the parent
- Create a nicer hand-off between registration and email
- Allow users to change the email if entered incorrectly
- Remove distractions of the main navigation while registering
- Confusing between 'Owner name' and 'Monster name'
- As Moshi had over 50m accounts kids found it difficult to find a username that wasn't taken
- After registering there was no tutorial


#### Revamped registration
Working with [Ram Kanda](https://twitter.com/ramkanda) and [James Kirkwood](http://www.jameskirkwood.com/) we managed to solve all of these key issues, with clearer tips through the process to previous users getting stuck, a username generator and clearly separated sections for the child and parent. We also added a new tutorial experience to ensure that kids got a Moshling during their first play session - previously this wasn't possible as they had to wait 12-hours for the seeds to grow!

### Game UI
Working with [Ram Kanda](https://twitter.com/ramkanda) and [James Kirkwood](http://www.jameskirkwood.com/) we worked to improve the Moshi Monsters UI. Key areas of focus were to allow players to access core functionality across the whole game (before it was restricted to their room), create a new way to message players, and re-design the main navigation to remove confusing around accessing your room.

![Old UI](/images/moshi/moshiold7.png)

##### Key issues:
- Social features could only be accessed from the player's room
- No way to message players of new updates/ features other than multiple pop-ups
- In the top navigation it wasn't clear how to get back to your room (the house icon by the username)
- Map didn't feature any indications of where you could go or  what was There

#### Updated UI
The new updated UI kept to the fun aesthetic of Moshi while making tweaks to make the game easier to play and created new tools for the developers to surface new content and events within the game. The frame and background was also updated to match the rich graphics found in the game.

### Secret codes
This was a short but fun project, working with [Ram Kanda](https://twitter.com/ramkanda) as the UI designer. Players could be awarded secret codes from competitions and physical toys, but the only way to enter the codes was by logging out and adding it when you logged back in. This could be frustrating if you had many codes and didn't offer any feedback as to whether your code was successful. There was also confusion between membership codes which offered a set period of premium access and secret codes as these were technically different systems.

##### Key issues:
- Had to log out to enter a secret code
- No way to navigate to entering a code from the game
- No feedback whether the code was successful or not
- Difficult to enter multiple codes in one session
- Confusion between secret codes and membership codes


#### Secret Codes - IGGY edition
We redesigned secret codes to have their own pages that could be accessed from within the game. This gave users a consistent place that they could access it. We wanted to make the experience of unlocking a secret code so we designed it around a popular Moshling - Iggy. After you enter a code Iggy eats the code and returns the reward (or spits it out if it's not valid), this ensures that players always know what they unlocked with their code. To reduce confusion with membership codes, we have a link in the top right to prompt users to the correct location.
