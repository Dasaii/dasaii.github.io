### TL;DR
Words

### Problem
For over a decade PwC have run an annual CEO survey called [Digital IQ](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/digital-iq.html) to help businesses better understand how they can use technology to improve their business.

PwC's research indicated widespread problem with companies reporting that:
- 63% lack skilled teams
- 45% have slow or inflexible processes
- 51% lack new data or technology integrations
- 63% use outdated or obsolete technologies

While I was at Play we worked with PwC to design an innovative solution to help businesses not only embrace new technology but to help change the company culture to be more innovative, agile and customer focused.

### Process
We began with a 2-week Sprint 0 (design Sprint) to: help us understand the problem; propose and iterate on potential solutions; and define/ estimate a potential pilot to prove our idea. A core theme we decided on was moving from focusing on the C-Suite executives to the whole organisation, as ultimately the day-to-day decisions that make a company successful aren't only made by executives!

After building an initial [Marvel](https://marvelapp.com) prototype to share with stakeholders we built an initial MVP version to test with a PwC client. From that success we built and ran an agile team with myself as Product lead, 1 UX/UI designer, 2 developers, 1 project manager and QA. Working closely with PwC to understand future requirements, pitching feature areas and running the product as a live service. During this time we worked with stakeholders from across the business to allow them to use Digital Fitness for their part of the business.
