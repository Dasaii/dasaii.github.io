### TL;DR
Words

### Background
Early 2013 Instagram had 90m active users (a far cry from the >1B today) but was already popular with kids, even though it didn't have any of the safeguards necessary to create a safe environment. In-fact all the major social and messaging products had a large user base of <13 year olds, even though these products were 'technically' restricted to 13+ because of COPPA laws.

While I was at Mind Candy as we worked on [Moshi Monsters](/work/moshi-monsters) we were acutely aware of these issues. At one of the quarterly town halls Michael Acton Smith, the CEO, presented an idea to create a safe chat app for kids using the expertise the company has grown running Moshi Monsters for the last 5 years. Myself and 3 other colleagues ([Dan Atherton](https://twitter.com/RabidBadger80), [Ed Harrison](http://whatwhat.co.uk/ed/) and [Noel Markham](https://twitter.com/noelmarkham)) decided we would make a prototype in our spare time to show our vision for how this product could work.
