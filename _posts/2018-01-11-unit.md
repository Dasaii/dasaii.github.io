### TL;DR
I started experimenting with SwiftUI to build and ship my own apps during the COVID-19 lock downs. My first app was a cooking unit converter, to make it easier for me to follow recipes from the US. It allows you to convert between volume and weight by selecting an ingredient (to determine the density). Later I released a version to convert between many types of units

The app has had over 15,000 downloads and has 4.9⭐️ reviews.

### Unit converter
The simplest (and most colourful!) way to convert between 10 categories of units.
Easily customise & reorder your list of most used units for easy access. No need to manually switch between units, any values entered will be automatically calculated for all others.

#### Features
- Convert between 10 categories and 75+ units
- Great for cooking - select an ingredient to convert between weight and volume
- Multi-units for imperial measurements e.g. feet and inches
- Built-in calculator
- Add your most used units, forget about the rest
- Reorder units
- Quickly swipe between categories
- Automatically calculate all units at once
- Factions support
- Offline
- Completely ad-free
- No tracking
- Dark mode
- Colourful fun UI
- UK, US and metric units supported

Convert between: cooking, length, weight, temperature, area, volume, speed, time, energy and pressure.
