### TL;DR
We helped make engineers jobs easier and more engaging, ultimately helping reduce the time it took for collected data to be stored from 6 months to 1 day and massively improving data quality.

### Problem
While at <a href="/work/play">Play</a>, we were approached by Thames Water to help improve the performance of their engineers, specifically around data collection. The current system they were using relied on giant Excel spreadsheets, was error prone and took 6 months for the data to be properly stored in their systems.

### My role
I ran the initial 2-week sprint 0 to scope the pilot product working with Jez Fischer as the UI designer and Dan Atherton to estimate the technical requirements. ???

### What we did
#### Process
We began with a 2-week Sprint 0 (design Sprint) to: help us understand the problem; propose and iterate on a potential solutions; and define and estimate a potential pilot to prove our idea. The Sprint 0 allows us to remain agile (not committing to any estimates before we know what we're building) and gives the client confidence, as they only have to commit to an initial 2 weeks of work.

#### Discovery
We started the Sprint 0 by running a workshop with stakeholders and engineers to help us understand the engineers current day-to-day role, the problems they encounter, devices they have access to and any other requirements to ensure the project could be a success. We then ran a short gamification workshop to help the engineers understand what's possible and to see what ideas resonated with them.

We identified these project goals:
- Make it easy for engineers to collect data while on site
- Support the capture of high quality data
- Motivate engineers to continually collect comprehensive datasets over time
- Reduce the time spent by managers checking data - helping them spend their time more efficiently
- Allow managers to easily verify new equipment to ensure consistency across complete surveys
- Take advantage of the platform (photos, GPS) to streamline data collection

#### Wireframes
We worked iteratively as a team with Thames Water, using wireframes to convey concepts visually as quickly as possible.

#### Solution
We decided to focus on a gamified solution that helps to motivate engineers by creating a team-based games, where they win by improving their team's performance. We shifted the perception by branding it "The Great Asset Hunt", repositioning how the engineers thought about their work and making it fun. Working with Jez Fischer, we designed the UI based on the wireframes I created. We built a prototype using [Marvel](http://marvelapp.com) to test our initial designs with engineers.

#### Development
We had agreed to build an MVP to pilot with a small group of engineers in 6-sprints (12-weeks) to test our hypothesis. 

### Outcome
Words words words words
