### TL;DR
I'm currently Director, Product Design at Deputy, supporting our wonderful team of Product Designers. As we scaled the business to over 1.5 million daily users, I've played a key role in shaping intuitive, user-centric experiences that drive efficiency and engagement across a diverse range of problem areas, company sizes and industries.

### What is Deputy?
[Deputy](https://deputy.com), a workforce management platform dedicated to improving the world of work one shift at a time. Deputy helps businesses manage scheduling, time tracking, and employee communication, empowering both employers and hourly workers. 



### My journey to Deputy
After 6-months travelling around South East Asia and Japan, I arrived to Sydney on a working holiday visa. In my first week in the country I attended a UX event, that just so happened to be hosted in the old Deputy office. During that event I was lucky enough to talk to Lisi Schappi (Senior Director, Design), we hit it off and I returned the next week for a formal interview.

I joined as a Lead Product Designer working across multiple product areas, over time my role grew to include managing some of the team before I was formally promoted to design manager and then Director of Product Design.

### Design team
We are a super creative and passionate bunch of product designers, you can see what we're up to on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/designingdeputy)

### Cool projects

Some exciting projects led by our design team.

#### Shifting Design
While missing seeing the broader design communicating during the COVID-19 lock downs, we ran our own virtual conference to hangout, share ideas and learn from our fellow designers.

#### Shift Worker Sunday
Our marketing and design teams got together to create Shift Worker Sunday, a new day to celebrate and thank the shift workers in our lives. As part of our product design team, we created an in app yearly wrap up experience for shift workers to thank them for their hard work.

#### Refreshing the Deputy
In 2021 we looked to refresh Deputy's brand to better position our brand a welcoming and trust worthy expert to our customers. It was a huge company wide effort, and we used it as an opportunity to refresh our product and design system to better reflect our brand.

      "Dave is a an example of energy and passion for all things product. Dave and his team know how to deliver quality product but he also made it fun and exciting. So many times I recall being on a global product call where, in the nitty gritty detail of the UX designs, Dave would geek out and get super passionate about the little details -- the details that make or break a great customer experiences. It is no surprise that the product he has led for many years is highly rated and loved by those who use it. I always felt comfortable sharing customer and my personal feedback with Dave because I knew he was a pro and wanted to hear the unfiltered customer perspective. Dave also routinely stepped up and led DEI initiatives including many that were built into the product that rallied our company around a mission more than just product. I just cant say enough about what a pro Dave is. I regard him in the top 1% of product leaders I've ever worked with -- thank you, Dave for your hard work and leadership."
